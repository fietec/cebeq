> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in development and not even near completion!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The intended build system is [nob](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h). 
> For those not based enough to use nob, I added a Makefile as well, though I won't guarantee that it will always be up to date.
